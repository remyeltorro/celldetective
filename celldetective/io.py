	Parameters
	----------
	experiment : str
		Path to the experiment folder to load data for.
	population : str, optional
		The population to extract from the position tables (`'targets'` or `'effectors'`). Default is `'targets'`.
	well_option : str or list, optional
		Specifies which wells to include. Default is `'*'`, meaning all wells.
	position_option : str or list, optional

	Interpret and resolve the path for a tracking configuration file.

	This function determines the appropriate configuration file path based on the input.
	If the input is a string representing an existing path or a known configuration name, 
	it resolves to the correct file path. If the input is invalid or `None`, a default 
	configuration is returned.

	Parameters
	----------
	config : str or None
		The input configuration, which can be:
		- A string representing the full path to a configuration file.
		- A short name of a configuration file without the `.json` extension.
		- `None` to use a default configuration.

	Returns
	-------
	str
		The resolved path to the configuration file.

	Notes
	-----
	- If `config` is a string and the specified path exists, it is returned as-is.
	- If `config` is a name, the function searches in the `tracking_configs` directory 
	  within the `celldetective` models folder.
	- If the file or name is not found, or if `config` is `None`, the function falls 
	  back to a default configuration using `cell_config()`.

	Examples
	--------
	Resolve a full path:

	"""
	Relabel the segmentation labels with the tracking IDs from the tracks.

	The function reassigns the mask value for each cell with the associated `TRACK_ID`, if it exists
	in the trajectory table (`df`). If no track uses the cell mask, a new track with a single point
	is generated on the fly (max of `TRACK_ID` values + i, for i=0 to N such cells). It supports 
	multithreaded processing for faster execution on large datasets.

	Parameters
	----------
	labels : np.ndarray
		A (TYX) array where each frame contains a 2D segmentation mask. Each unique 
		non-zero integer represents a labeled object.
	df : pandas.DataFrame
		A DataFrame containing tracking information with columns 
		specified in `column_labels`. Must include at least frame, track ID, and object ID.
	exclude_nans : bool, optional
		Whether to exclude rows in `df` with NaN values in the column specified by 
		`column_labels['label']`. Default is `True`.
	column_labels : dict, optional
		A dictionary specifying the column names in `df`. Default is:
		- `'track'`: Track ID column name (`"TRACK_ID"`)
		- `'frame'`: Frame column name (`"FRAME"`)
		- `'y'`: Y-coordinate column name (`"POSITION_Y"`)
		- `'x'`: X-coordinate column name (`"POSITION_X"`)
		- `'label'`: Object ID column name (`"class_id"`)
	threads : int, optional
		Number of threads to use for multithreaded processing. Default is `1`.

	Returns
	-------
	np.ndarray
		A new (TYX) array with the same shape as `labels`, where objects are relabeled 
		according to their tracking identity in `df`.

	Notes
	-----
	- For frames where labeled objects in `labels` do not match any entries in the `df`,
	  new track IDs are generated for the unmatched labels.
	- The relabeling process maintains synchronization across threads using a shared
	  counter for generating unique track IDs.

	Examples
	--------
	Relabel segmentation using tracking data:

	"""
	Controls the tracking of cells or objects within a given position by locating the relevant image stack and label data,
	and then visualizing and managing the tracks in the Napari viewer.

	Parameters
	----------
	position : str
		The path to the directory containing the position's data. The function will ensure the path uses forward slashes.
	
	prefix : str, optional, default="Aligned"
		The prefix of the file names for the image stack and labels. This parameter helps locate the relevant data files.
	
	population : str, optional, default="target"
		The population to be tracked, typically either "target" or "effectors". This is used to identify the group of interest for tracking.
	
	relabel : bool, optional, default=True
		If True, will relabel the tracks, potentially assigning new track IDs to the detected objects.
	
	flush_memory : bool, optional, default=True
		If True, will flush memory after processing to free up resources.
	
	threads : int, optional, default=1
		The number of threads to use for processing. This can speed up the task in multi-threaded environments.

	Returns
	-------
	None
		The function performs visualization and management of tracks in the Napari viewer. It does not return any value.

	Notes
	-----
	- This function assumes that the necessary data for tracking (stack and labels) are located in the specified position directory.
	- The `locate_stack_and_labels` function is used to retrieve the image stack and labels from the specified directory.
	- The tracks are visualized using the `view_tracks_in_napari` function, which handles the display in the Napari viewer.
	- The function can be used for tracking biological entities (e.g., cells) and their movement across time frames in an image stack.

	"""
	Converts a dataframe of tracked objects into the bTrack output format.
	The function prepares tracking data, properties, and an empty graph structure for further processing.

	Parameters
	----------
	df : pandas.DataFrame
		A dataframe containing tracking information. The dataframe must have columns for `TRACK_ID`, 
		`FRAME`, `POSITION_Y`, `POSITION_X`, and `class_id` (among others).

	exclude_nans : bool, optional, default=False
		If True, rows with NaN values in the `class_id` column will be excluded from the dataset.
		If False, the dataframe will retain all rows, including those with NaN in `class_id`.

	Returns
	-------
	data : numpy.ndarray
		A 2D numpy array containing the tracking data with columns `[TRACK_ID, FRAME, z, POSITION_Y, POSITION_X]`.
		The `z` column is set to zero for all rows.

	properties : dict
		A dictionary where keys are property names (e.g., 'FRAME', 'state', 'generation', etc.) and values are numpy arrays
		containing the corresponding values from the dataframe.

	graph : dict
		An empty dictionary intended to store graph-related information for the tracking data. It can be extended
		later to represent relationships between different tracking objects.
	
	Notes
	-----
	- The function assumes that the dataframe contains specific columns: `TRACK_ID`, `FRAME`, `POSITION_Y`, `POSITION_X`, 
	  and `class_id`. These columns are used to construct the tracking data and properties.
	- The `z` coordinate is set to 0 for all tracks since the function does not process 3D data.
	- This function is useful for transforming tracking data into a format that can be used by tracking graph algorithms.

	"""
	Correct segmentation masks to ensure consistency and remove anomalies.

	This function processes a labeled mask image to correct anomalies and reassign labels. 
	It performs the following operations:
	
	1. Corrects negative mask values by taking their absolute values.
	2. Identifies and corrects segmented objects with a bounding box area that is disproportionately 
	   larger than the actual object area. This indicates potential segmentation errors where separate objects 
	   share the same label.
	3. Removes small objects that are considered noise (default threshold is an area of less than 9 pixels).
	4. Reorders the labels so they are consecutive from 1 up to the number of remaining objects (to avoid encoding errors).

	Parameters
	----------
	masks : np.ndarray
		A 2D array representing the segmented mask image with labeled regions. Each unique value 
		in the array represents a different object or cell.

	Returns
	-------
	clean_labels : np.ndarray
		A corrected version of the input mask, with anomalies corrected, small objects removed, 
		and labels reordered to be consecutive integers.

	Notes
	-----
	- This function is useful for post-processing segmentation outputs to ensure high-quality 
	  object detection, particularly in applications such as cell segmentation in microscopy images.
	- The function assumes that the input masks contain integer labels and that the background 
	  is represented by 0.

	Parameters
	----------
	multichannel_frame : ndarray
		The input multichannel image frame to be normalized, expected to be a 3-dimensional array where the last dimension
		represents the channels.
	percentiles : list of tuples or tuple, optional
		Percentile ranges (low, high) for each channel used to scale the intensity values. If a single tuple is provided,
		it is applied to all channels. If None, the default percentile range of (0., 99.99) is used for each channel.
	values : list of tuples or tuple, optional
		Direct value ranges (min, max) for each channel to scale the intensity values. If a single tuple is provided, it
		is applied to all channels. This parameter overrides `percentiles` if provided.
	ignore_gray_value : float, optional
		A specific gray value to ignore during normalization (default is 0.).
	clip : bool, optional
		If True, clips the output values to the range [0, 1] or the specified `dtype` range if `dtype` is not float
		(default is False).
	amplification : float, optional
		A factor by which to amplify the intensity values after normalization. If None, no amplification is applied.
	dtype : data-type, optional
		The desired data-type for the output normalized frame. The default is float, but other types can be specified

	Loads and optionally normalizes and rescales specified frames from a stack located at a given path.

	This function reads specified frames from a stack file, applying systematic adjustments to ensure
	the channel axis is last. It supports optional normalization of the input frames and rescaling. An
	artificial pixel modification is applied to frames with uniform values to prevent errors during
	normalization.

	Parameters
	----------
	img_nums : int or list of int
		The index (or indices) of the image frame(s) to load from the stack.
	stack_path : str
		The file path to the stack from which frames are to be loaded.
	scale : float, optional
		The scaling factor to apply to the frames. If None, no scaling is applied (default is None).
	normalize_input : bool, optional
		Whether to normalize the loaded frames. If True, normalization is applied according to
		`normalize_kwargs` (default is True).
	dtype : data-type, optional

	normalize_kwargs : dict, optional
		Keyword arguments to pass to the normalization function (default is {"percentiles": (0., 99.99)}).

	Returns
	-------
	ndarray or None
		The loaded, and possibly normalized and rescaled, frames as a NumPy array. Returns None if there

	Raises
	------
	Exception
		Prints an error message if the specified frames cannot be loaded or if there is a mismatch between

	Notes
	-----
	- The function uses scikit-image for reading frames and supports multi-frame TIFF stacks.
	- Normalization and scaling are optional and can be customized through function parameters.

	Computes the normalization value ranges (minimum and maximum) for each channel in a 4D stack based on specified percentiles.

	This function calculates the value ranges for normalizing each channel within a 4-dimensional stack, with dimensions
	expected to be in the order of Time (T), Y (height), X (width), and Channels (C). The normalization values are determined
	by the specified percentiles for each channel. An option to ignore a specific gray value during computation is provided,
	though its effect is not implemented in this snippet.

	Parameters
	----------
	stack : ndarray
		The input 4D stack with dimensions TYXC from which to calculate normalization values.
	percentiles : tuple, list of tuples, optional
		The percentile values (low, high) used to calculate the normalization ranges for each channel. If a single tuple
		is provided, it is applied to all channels. If a list of tuples is provided, each tuple is applied to the
		corresponding channel. If None, defaults to (0., 99.99) for each channel.
	ignore_gray_value : float, optional
		A gray value to potentially ignore during the calculation. This parameter is provided for interface consistency
		but is not utilized in the current implementation (default is 0.).

	Returns
	-------
	list of tuples
		A list where each tuple contains the (minimum, maximum) values for normalizing each channel based on the specified

	Raises
	------
	AssertionError
		If the input stack does not have 4 dimensions, or if the length of the `percentiles` list does not match the number

	Notes
	-----
	- The function assumes the input stack is in TYXC format, where T is the time dimension, Y and X are spatial dimensions,
