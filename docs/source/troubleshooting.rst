Napari issues
-------------

Black screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*napari* opens to a black screen with the following error messages:

.. code-block:: bash

    WARNING: QOpenGLWidget: Failed to create context
    parallel.py (371): The TBB threading layer requires TBB version 2021 update 6 or later i.e., TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION >= 12060. Found TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION = 12050. The TBB threading layer is disabled.
    WARNING: QOpenGLWidget: Failed to create context
    WARNING: composeAndFlush: QOpenGLContext creation failed
    WARNING: composeAndFlush: makeCurrent() failed

A potential fix is to create a symbolic link to libraries not found by *napari* in your python environment (here a conda environment named celldetective):

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/anaconda3/envs/celldetective/lib
    mkdir backup 
    mv libstd* backup
    cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6  ./ 
    ln -s libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so
    ln -s libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.0.19

Deep learning libraries
-----------------------

Pytorch
~~~~~~~

On older hardware, Pytorch may yield the following error:

.. code-block:: console

    Pytorch: [W NNPACK.cpp:64] Could not initialize NNPACK! Reason: Unsupported hardware.

A potential fix is to install Pytorch through `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mamba remove pytorch
    $ mamba install pytorch

The following error (when training a model): 

.. code-block:: console
    
    usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torch/lib/../../nvidia/cusparse/lib/libcusparse.so.12: undefined symbol: __nvJitLinkAddData_12_1, version libnvJitLink.so.12

can be fixed by reinstalling torchvision and torchaudio:

.. console-block:: console
    
    $ python -m pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
    $ python -m pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu121

Tensorflow
~~~~~~~~~~

On older hardware, Tensorflow may yield the following error:

.. code-block:: console

    Tensorflow: Illegal instruction (core dumped)
    The TensorFlow library was compiled to use AVX instructions, but these aren't available on your machine.

A potential fix is to install Tensorflow through `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    conda remove tensorflow
    mamba remove tensorflow
    mamba install tensorflow

StarDist
~~~~~~~~

When training a StarDist model on an older CPU the following error can be triggered:

.. code-block:: console

    pyopencl._cl.LogicError: clGetPlatformIDs failed: PLATFORM_NOT_FOUND_KHR

Try to install the missing pocl library as:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install pocl-binary-distribution

Multithreading
--------------

Setting too many threads for the device you are using may lead to jobs aborting silently. This has been observed in the segmentation jobs. If you notice that whole label frames are missing, try to decrease the number of threads in the settings. 

.. note::

    In general, avoid combining both the use of GPU and multithreading as it may lead to memory issues.
